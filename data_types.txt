Data Types
MongoDB supports a variety of data types that allow for flexibility and complexity.

String: Commonly used for text data, e.g., "name": "Alice".
Number: Stores integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., "age": 30.
Boolean: Represents true or false, e.g., "isActive": true.
Date: Stores date and time, often used for timestamps.
Array: A list of values, e.g., "hobbies": ["reading", "travelling"].
Object: Stores embedded documents (nested objects), e.g., "address".
ObjectId: A 12-byte unique identifier for each document, assigned by default to _id.
Null: Represents the absence of a value.
